# What is this ?
In this repository, you'll find all the problems I've solved—or attempted to solve—from the Romanian version of "LeetCode", pbinfo.ro.

I chose to work on problems from this site mainly because it's the primary platform we use in my high school.

In case you're wondering about the file names (especially the numbers), they're just the problem numbers from the site—kind of like how LeetCode numbers its problems.

Have fun exploring my solutions! ;)
